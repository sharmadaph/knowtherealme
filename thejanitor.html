  <h5><p class = "a">  As teenagers, having a balance in daily life is hard. There is so much going on in life, many times we do not have the time to stop and think. For many teenagers, school is the only thing in mind, instead of their well being. <i>The Janitor—How an Unexpected Friendship Transformed a CEO and His Company</i>, written by Todd Hopkins and Ray Hilber, shows an individual how to have a balanced life through six directives. . 
</p>
<br> <p class="a">The first directive, <i>Recharge Versus Discharge </i>, is quite simple. As teeagers, juggling many things at once can be really tiring. By the time the clubs have been attended and the homework is done, many teengaers are burned up and don’t have the energy to spend time on themselves. This surectives, Recharge Versus Discharge, helps recharge the brain to accomplish more. Since a “burned up brain won’t start”, recharging the brain by doing a different activity for a change, helps very much. When doing a different task than the usual, the mind has time to rest and recharge to its full potential. 
  </p>
<br> <p class="a"> <i>View Family as a Blessing not a Responsibility </i>, being the second directive, comes in handy quite often for a teenager. Numerous times, we think parents never understand the stress and the amount of work we have. They ask us to do chores, not to eat food inside the room, clean the room, when they don’t understand the work piling up. As teenagers, we feel like many times, family is a responsibility and feel like we would be free once we went to college. When viewing family as a burden, coming home is the worst thing possible. Although, once we see family as a blessing, we see the sacrifices many of them made and enjoy spending time with them. Sometimes, seeing things from their point of view helps build a healthier relationship. 
 </p> 
 <br> <h5><p class="a">  The third directive, <i>Pray, don’t Pout</i>, is accepting the reality and taking the next steps. Whether you believe in religion or not, accepting reality is hard and acting towards it is harder. Although, once we accept the reality, moving on is easier .Complaining is very  easy, especially about things that cannot be controlled. But, understanding the problem and asking for the strength to face it will teach many teens how to move on. 
 </p>
 <br> <h5><p class="a"> <i> Pass It Around </i>, the fourth directive, means just that—Pass It Around. As teenagers, there is a lot of competition between each of us. Although, passing knowledge around to others, will be easier for others to go through their teenage years. Helping others, or passing around valuable information can change one’s life—help them feel like they are not alone. Being teenagers can be a taxing time, but helping others can ease the pain.  how to move on.

<br> <h5><p class="a">  The fifth directive being,<i> Don’t Spend—Invest </i>, isn’t talking about money, but time. The difference between spending time is using time as a way to pass time. Investing time with others, can help develop healthy relations among each other. When spending time one something that doesn’t mean much to you, is wasting the time. Seeing significance in how you spend time can help use the time to focus on things that you can invest in. When investing time and energy in something, like family, is a huge investment as the relationship grows. 

 </p> 
 <br><p class="a">The last directive is <i> Leave A Legacy </i>. When gaining knowledge, don’t just use it for that time being, but in the future as well. For example, when you passway, what will that dash mean between the two dates. The dash will signify the time you have spent on the earth, but what exactly does that time worth. When you leave a legacy, doesn’t always mean to make sure everyone knows who you are. Leaving a legacy is the difference you make in one life. If you make a difference in one person's life, you have left a legacy. 

 </p>
 <br><p class="a">With these six directives, being a child to a teenager and into an adult will help ease transitions and help you become a better person. As teengers, we feel like we are in the deepest trench of the ocean, and aren’t able to swim back to the top, but with these few directives, the swimming will be easier. Now, to ponder upon, how will this book be any use to you?
