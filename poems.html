     <div class="centered"> <h3> Why Do We Cry? </h3>
       <h4>Why do we cry when our heart aches? <br>
Why do we cry when our heart smiles?<br>
Why do we cry, we ask our heart?<br>
We cry, it replies: <br>
Because when the the trees say goodbye to the leaves in fall, <br>
It knows they’ll meet again.<br>
Because when the sun and moon smile at each other twice a day, <br>
They know their smile will return again tomorrow<br>
Because when your tears streak you makeup, <br>
You let it because you know they’ll come again<br>
Because when the waves roll up to you feet and sink them, <br>
You know they will sink them again <br>
But when you feel the warmth in hugging someone<br>
You smile, not knowing, you’ll never hug them again.

  <div class="centered"> <h3> From Now On </h3>  
  <h4>Motivation lost, vanished from our drive. <br>
Something needs to be reached, achieved, perceived <br>
The clock is ticking, but times are sticking. <br>
Friends to be missed, <br>
Birthdays going on waiting lists. <br>
Staying at home was a change. <br>
Now it is just strange  <br>
Nothing, I repeat nothing will ever be the same. <br>
Not our jobs, not our ur knowledge, not our skills <br>
And certainly not our electricity bills.  <br>
Being positive is something we need  <br>
This is our time to exceed.  <br>
Let’s stay at home <br>
So when this is all over we can roam <br> </h4>

  <div class="centered"> <h3> More Than You See </h3>  
  <h4>The water that trickled down her face was more than just tears.<br>
It was more than just the buckets of emptiness she held.<br>
Her eyes held moments of uncertainty.<br>
Her scars held more than just her past <br>
But had the power to influence her future.<br>
Her lips held the words that refused to set free. <br>
Her legs held  power to run. <br>
But her mind decided to walk.<br>
Her heart held hope from which she saw tinted a future <br>
For her life ended yesterday <br>
But she began a new one today.<br>
For she is a Phoenix.<br>

  <h4>  Quietly we tried to sleep <br>
Light were still flashed on<br>
We tried not to wake up<br>
In the room beside, crying began.<br>
“You were a disgrace”<br>
The profane little man spoke. <br>
Waves of crying radiated the room.<br>
We heard it. <br>
Awfully, he pushing her back<br>
Glasses slipped out <br>
Irritation in his voice began.<br>
A subtle change.<br>
He thrust her at the connecting door <br>
“Don’t come near me!”<br>
Her crying, her pleading. <br>
He ate his way through her. <br>
These days, <br>
We waited until the lights switched off<br>
They stayed throughout the entire night.<br>
Tomorrow, maybe, it’ll be over. <br> </h4>

  <div class="centered"><h3> Closed Eyes Cannot See </h3>
  <h4>Cover your eyes and lay in bed. <br>
You’ll see a few things you have never seen before. <br>
Hatred to an extent, it is impossible to get through.<br> 
Lives lost where pleading to God won’t bring them back.<br>
Where stepping outside is a danger but the urge we are unable to control<br>
These times have brought pain and sadness to the soul<br>
The time to meet your friends took a handshake. <br>
Now, because the phone was held too long your hand aches.

<div class="centered"><h3> Tears </h3>
<h4> Staring at the window were eyes that followed the drops of water slide through the glass. <br>
It seemed to match the way salt water dripped down cheeks to her chin, <br>
Creating silent cries that screamed through her eyes. <br>
The lightning paralyzing her mind<br>
And the floods that followed left her trembling behind. <br>
Minutes prolonged to hours.<br>
Her eyes remained shut which wouldn’t open like buds of flowers.<br>
She had no one to hug, and no one to see her smile,<br>
So she remained in bed and cried for a while.<br>
