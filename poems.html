     <div class="centered"> <h3> Why Do We Cry? </h3>
       <h4>Why do we cry when our heart aches? <br>
Why do we cry when our heart smiles?<br>
Why do we cry, we ask our heart?<br>
We cry, it replies: <br>
Because when the the trees say goodbye to the leaves in fall, <br>
It knows they’ll meet again.<br>
Because when the sun and moon smile at each other twice a day, <br>
They know their smile will return again tomorrow<br>
Because when your tears streak you makeup, <br>
You let it because you know they’ll come again<br>
Because when the waves roll up to you feet and sink them, <br>
You know they will sink them again <br>
But when you feel the warmth in hugging someone<br>
You smile, not knowing, you’ll never hug them again.
<br></h4>

  <h4>  Quietly we tried to sleep <br>
Light were still flashed on<br>
We tried not to wake up<br>
In the room beside, crying began.<br>
“You were a disgrace”<br>
The profane little man spoke. <br>
Waves of crying radiated the room.<br>
We heard it. <br>
Awfully, he pushing her back<br>
Glasses slipped out <br>
Irritation in his voice began.<br>
A subtle change.<br>
He thrust her at the connecting door <br>
“Don’t come near me!”<br>
Her crying, her pleading. <br>
He ate his way through her. <br>
These days, <br>
We waited until the lights switched off<br>
They stayed throughout the entire night.<br>
Tomorrow, maybe, it’ll be over. <br> </h4>
