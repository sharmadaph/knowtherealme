  <h5><p class = "a"> Change is the only constant in life, and often change takes time to accept.  Many times, keeping up with change is tough and disliked—especially when least expected. Being a teenager can be tiring as they are simultaneously learning how to grow into adults, as well as discovering who they are. For this reason, teenagers often have a hard time adapting to change. <i>Who Moved My Cheese?</i>, written by Spencer Johnson, integrates short stories (about change) to help deal with change in a positive manner.  He uses cheese to symbolize a job, a relationship, or something of importance to a person. 

</p>
<br> <p class="a">Learning how to anticipate change is one of the main ideas present in the book. Noticing the small changes happening from time to time helps anticipate change. For example, this year, my parents broke the news to my siblings and me that our family was moving. As a rising sophomore, I was upset as I couldn’t finish my studies in one school. We had moved several times in the past, although this seemed harder. I was confused as I never remembered moving to be part of any conversation. Although  moving should have been expected. My parents had been talking about moving for quite some time. As a teenager, I was caught up with school, clubs, and friends and didn't pay attention to the small changes around me. Anticipating change can be very hard because sometimes, we don’t want things to change. As teenagers, we want to feel comfortable, especially when we aren’t feeling good. When too much comfort is found, change cannot be anticipated. The small hints will go unnoticed, and when change happens, it will take longer to accept it.

  </p>
<br> <p class="a">Another main idea that popped up throughout the book was to face your fears. Everyone has fears, and there isn’t one person in the world who isn’t afraid of something. Facing your fears doesn’t mean standing in the middle of the forest and having animals attack you (that would not be smart). Facing your fears means to understand that fearing change, school, or even cats, wouldn’t be as bad as you would have thought. Numerous times, when you face your fears, you overcome them too. For instance, one day I was in the garage and a sound. Thinking it was a rat,  I ran inside and shut the door. For the longest time I never entered the garage thinking the rat would kill me. Although one day after a few weeks, my parents persisted that I go to the garage to face my fears. I stepped into the garage and heard the sound again, but this time I realized they were my shoes. Being is scared is acceptable, being scared all the time can affect your mental health and can make you overthink a lot more.

<br> <h5><p class="a">  In all honesty, change <i>is</i> the only constant in life. Everything around oneself changes—personalities, bodies, days, friends, names, and so much more. Rather than go against change, accepting it and moving on helps one feel more relaxed. Often enough, change pops up at the least expected times. Taking time to get adjusted to change is quite natural, although accepting change should be quicker. For example, when the global pandemic began, ninety percent of the time, time wasn’t used correctly. I often scrolled through instagram, watched netflix, and whiled away time. I hadn’t adjusted to the idea of quarantine since I hadn’t accepted it. It took me time to realize that the time I wasn’t spending productively wasn't coming back. Therefore, I took the initiative to accept the huge shift and created a new routine. This helps adjust to change much faster as the “accepting the change” part has passed.

 </p> 
 <br><p class="a">When there is a new shift or change that happens in someone's life, many times, people look back on how great the past was. As the saying goes, “The grass is greener on the other side.” connects directly to clinging on to the past. As fast as the <i> Rope of the Past </i> is let go, the faster the present will be enjoyable. Often, we tend to hold on to the past as it gives us a sense of comfort. Although, as the “cheese” changes, you should look forward to it. This way, enjoying the present will be easier. For instance, when we relocated to theUnited States a few years ago, I felt anxious stepping into the airport. I was scared my friends would forget me. I clinged onto the past as a happy place (which wasn’t a bad thing), although I wasn’t able to live and enjoy the present. Living in the present doesn’t mean to let go of the past, but means not to dwell on it. 

 </p>
 <br><p class="a">Change can cost one many things in life when it is not understood and accepted. Dealing with change can be quite overwhelming, but we went along with it, it would be much easier. When annoyed or frustrated at change, something to remember is change is the only constant in life.
