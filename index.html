      <h1 class="writing"> About The Author </h1>
 <h3> Sharmada. Sharmada means Durga which is a Hindu Goddess. But my name is not the only thing that describes me. As a teenager, I am content but can be moody like every other teenager in the world. I grew up with hindi movies and that all I saw because I thought they were the most entertaining thing in the world. Now, I see a mixture of both english and hindi! Listening to music as well as singing it has become much more prominent in my life in the past few years.

 <h1> Reading and Poetry </h1>
 <h3> Reading can be tough especially when reading isn’t our favorite hobby to do. As a child, reading was the last thing on my mind and I barely read a few books throughout the years. After being introduced to the different genres in high school, I realized there is much more to reading than just words. Reading doesn’t only need to be romance, mysteries, science fiction, but can be a tool to improve oneself. Through the journey (while in quarantine) I picked up my first book (which I was actually excited to read) and began. Here are a few books I read which gives my opinion on them and how I felt after reading it. 

Poetry is something I always liked as a kid. I found it energizing to read something and dissect it to understand it. In poetry there is no right or wrong answer but is white board where your ideas flow. As a amatuer poet myself I decided to write a few poems just as my thoughts flowed through my mind. I hope you enjoy them!
