<h1>5 Dysfunctions of a Team</h1>
<h3> <i>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team </i>author, Patrick Lencioni, uses storytelling to unravel the five dysfunctions of a team. It begins with a team who does not know how to work together and consequently aren’t reaching their full potential. Therefore, a new CEO is appointed who has the responsibility to bring the team together. Through this journey, the team laughs, argues, overcomes ego, and learns to trust each other. From the point of the book, the five dysfunctions include Absence of Trust, Fear of Conflict, Lack of Commitment, Avoidance of Accountability, and Inattention to Results. Without overcoming all the dysfunctions, the team cannot succeed. 
“Absence of Trust” is the base of the pyramid. Without it, the team will not be able to continue the next steps. The problem starts as people on the team are unwilling to be themselves and are being guarded. Without trust, mistakes aren’t appreciated and risks aren’t taken. To help fix this, trust is needed. To overcome the absence of trust vulnerability needs to be expressed. Having trust in each other helps the team in various ways. As a team, they can “ask for help...take risks...focus time and energy on important issues, not on politics” (Lencioni 197) and much more. A key concept to understand is no matter in which relationship, trust is one of the most important concepts to understand. As a friend, sister, and daughter, I have realized that trusting the right someone can lead to great places for oneself and as a team. 
The next dysfunction that prevents people from becoming a team is “Fear of Conflict”. Fear of conflict doesn’t help the team air out their comments, concerns, and questions. Without conflict, the team cannot grow, and neither can the company. Many times avoiding the conversations and debates is easier but doesn’t help anyone. By building trust in the team, fear of conflict is easier to manage. This is easier as people do not “hesitate to engage in passionate and sometimes emotional debate”(Lencioni 202). By engaging in “passionate” and “emotional” debates, the team can pinpoint problems easier and faster. To start with, teams can begin having engrossing conversations and debates about the company or what the next step should be. Understanding the main problem and debating about them gives both sides a point of view. 
 The third dysfunction is “Lack of Commitment”. Lack of commitment in this case is the “desire for consensus and need for certainty” (Lencioni 207). The definition of “consensus” is making sure everyone is on the same page. Although, great teams have different points of view, and aren’t always on the same page. When a team is unsure about the path they are choosing, “certainty” is required. With either, a team cannot move forward. Since everything is interrelated, fear of conflict plays a huge role in this dysfunction. If the conflict is not present, the team needs to agree with whatever a team member may say. To commit, debates and conversations are needed to help the team understand it is all right to have differences. When a team commits they aren’t afraid to fail, helps confidence as a team, guilt doesn't guide unwanted decisions. Deadlines help teams commit to their projects, staff meetings help push commitment, and debating helps understand the situations. 
 The dysfunction following the “Lack of Commitment” is “Avoidance of Accountability”. Accountability has many definitions, but for this dysfunction, the most important is to call out team members if they aren’t performing or their attitude. In the book, there is one team member who has an attitude, and it is very important when having discussions, respect is very important. When team members aren’t willing to call their team members, it shows they have a lack of commitment. “Members of great teams improve relationships by holding one another accountable...” (Lencioni 213). “By holding one another accountable”, respect that is deserved is given. Teams that hold each other accountable, understand the pressure given and improve, question each other without feeling bad (unless not given respect), and making sure everyone is treated equally. Helping teams with accountability is hard. Team reviews and goals and standards for the team can be very benefitting 
 The last dysfunction is “Inattention to Results”. When the team pays attention to financial courses, they end up forgetting what they should achieve as a team. For example, when greed comes into place, employee status seems more important than team status. “Unfortunately… no amount of trust, conflict, commitments, or accountability can compensate for a lack of desire to win” (Lencioni 218). Sometimes, those people are the ones that need to be let go as they don’t understand ways to work as a team. Although, if those people change, they can make a great team that cares about the employees, enjoys both failure and success, and people in the team are team players. 
 Many times, a leader needs to know to bring a group of people and make them a team. This leader isn’t trying to change anyone, except when they aren’t being respectful. These five dysfunctions, when spotted, take time to correct. Nothing can go without each other. Without trust, the conflict will not exist. Without conflict, commitment won’t increase, so on and so forth. Sometimes making a good team is letting people go or hiring more.
