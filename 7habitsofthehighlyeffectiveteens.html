  <h5><p class = "a">  Being a teenager is beyond exhausting. Teenagers have to shuffle being a child as well as entering into adulthood. This period is challenging for every teenager out there. As teenagers we have to juggle work, studies, clubs, sports, and a hundred thousand other things. Honestly, adulthood isn’t as hard as being a teenager today. <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teenagers </i>, written by Sean Covey,  is a book to help oneself practice the seven habits through one's teenage years. These habits are paths that help carve the journey into adulthood, and assist each teenager to help enjoy their time as a teen. 
</p>
<br> <p class="a">As the introduction began, since every book has a prologue (boring!), this seemed different. There were comical pictures, interesting quotes, and relatable personal experiences.  For the first time (ever) a book looked enthralling. It united every one of the habits to each other—like the struggles we come across as teens. The first few pages showed perception about paradigms, the value of personal bank accounts (PBA), and the understanding of good principles. Bad paradigms are glasses that are worn which make our eyesight worse. Many times as teens, we make decisions in a split second which doesn’t give us the chance to analyze the situation. To change that a paradigm shift needs to take place. With new and clear glasses, a better understanding of things will develop. Personal Bank Accounts are more useful than they seem. These accounts help track down good and bad decisions/behavior. Showing kindness can add value and gossiping about someone can retract value. Good principles can help teens be centred on things that add equal value into their life. Many times being centered around school, friends, work, or sports, makes it hard to be balanced.  </p>
<br> <p class="a">Private battles with oneself happen every single day. Many times these battles tear us down. To help change these losses into victories takes time and baby steps. </p>
<br> <p class="a">The first habit is To Be Proactive. Being proactive is tiring. To see everything with a positive attitude is impossible because no one is perfect. Although, being proactive is responding to things in a positive attitude to things that we can control. As people itself, we tend to want control over things that we cannot control. For example, I am walking on the sidewalk and suddenly trip on a rock. Instead of getting angry on the rock (which I cannot control), I will continue walking and keeping my calm. These small decisions help add value to the Personal Bank Account. As Eliane Maxwell said, “Whether I fail or succeed shall be no man’s doing but my own. I am the force.” Being proactive helps small moments to bring huge amounts of positivity into life.

<br> <h5><p class="a">  The next step to reach private victories is to Begin With an End in Mind. In daily life hours seem to pass by with not much meaning. To help solve for the lost time, setting goals for the week or the day, helps keep track of time. By setting goals, we are able to understand how much we can accomplish. For example, when school transitioned into the online platform, I had plenty of extra time. In the beginning, the extra time wasn’t productively used, and to make up for that, goals were made everyday. These goals were small activities like cleaning my room more often or reading books. Setting a goal doesn’t always need to be physical, it can also be mental and emotional. Keeping goals to improve our personality helps us become the person we want to be. Goals are very important and pursuing the goals gives us a sense of productivity and positivity. 
 </p> 
 <br><p class="a">The final step in the private victories section is to Put First Things First. When setting goals, understanding what is critical is important. For example, when a friend asks to hangout today, but you cannot since you have to study for a test tomorrow, what will you do? Although, you want to spend time with them you need to determine which of these two activities needs to be put first. Procrastinating is a great example of not putting “first things first”. When important activities are put ahead of unimportant ones, we end up being happy with that decision instead of repenting it later. For instance, my family friend had asked me if I could sleepover, but I knew I had a class the next morning. Instead of saying “Sorry, I have a class tomorrow” I replied with a “Yes, let us do it!”. The next morning, I ended up missing the class and paid for my mistakes since that day the teacher had announced we had a test the next week. Unable to understand what was more important I didn’t do too well on the test the following week. Putting things that are important in front of others that are not, will help us try our best. 
 </p>
 <br><p class="a">Public victories, a little different than private victories, have much to do with relations with other people. This however, includes the Relationship Bank Account (RBA) which works the same way as the Personal Bank Account (except that it also consists of other people—relations). 
 </p>
 <br><p class="a">The first step to a public victory is to Think Win-Win. Frequently, people tend to think in a Win-Lose or Lose-Lose mindset. This ends up with people doing petty things to gain victory, or the mindset of  “If  I’m, coming down, you coming with me too”.  These mindsets help pride and ego come in the way instead of dealing with the problem or project. The Win-Lose sometimes makes sure that the other person is treated as a doormat. People just walk on them, only caring they won. With the Win-Win mindset both parties win. For example, when there is a player on the basketball team whose goal is to make sure they are noticed is the best representation of a Win-Lose mindset. Although, if the person can act like a teamplayer as well as the team winning the game,  it shows a Win-Win mindset.

 <br><h5> <p class="a"> The following habit is Seek to Understand, Then to be Understood. Don’t all of us want people to hear us out without interrupting us every five seconds? However, many times we do the same. We want people to understand our problem, when we always want people to understand us. When we listen, we understand, and when we understand, people feel understood. As people are listening to other people as they speak, the relationship grows. Listening also means to understand what the other person is going through. Staring at a person’s face and thinking about what you are going to have for dinner is the complete opposite of listening. To show that, nodding the head and definity not showing a blank face is important. After understanding the problem, give them your side, and they would probably do the same. 
 </p>
<br> <p class="a">  The next habit of the public victory section is to Synergize. Many people do not know the meaning of synergy (and honestly, neither did I). Synergy is working together as a team, being open to new ideas, and understanding that everyone is unique in their own ways. It also means being a team player and doing what is best for the team (without losing yourself). With teamwork, things get done faster, and the satisfaction of working as a team remains. For instance, when I was in middle school, there was a girl who always wanted to be ahead of the crowd. No one wanted to be in her team since she never seemed to be a great teamplayer. She would never let people brainstorm ideas since she didn’t have the confidence in her that she needed. To have synergy, confidence in oneself is very important, and to do so all the steps above need to be understood. 
 </p>
<br><p class="a"> The final habit of the book is to Sharpen the Saw. This habit is very important and crucial to understand. Sharpening the saw is to have balance in life (too much anything is bad). This habit gives a chance to unleash talents or to give a chance to things we haven’t before. There are four parts to this habit—body, heart, brain, and soul. To make sure each part is nourished we do a few activities for the four parts. For the body, exercise is very important, and well as eating healthy food. Relationships to oneself and others are good for the heart. Reading, writing, learning new skills, etc. comes into place for the brain. And finally to the soul, it is doing something that makes oneself happy. All these four parts make sure we are balanced and not too stressed in daily life. 
 </p> 

<br><p class="a"> These seven habits are important in anyone's life. It gives teens a chance to be themselves and be happy with who they are. Who we are is important, and during these years as teenagers, help us unravel important, quirky, facts about ourselves. With final words, something to remember is  “One kind word can warm three months of winter” (Japanese Saying).
